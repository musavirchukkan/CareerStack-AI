## 🔜 Up Next

- **Auto-publish to Chrome Web Store** — Push a version tag, and GitHub Actions handles the rest
- **Firefox support** — Cross-browser compatibility via `webextension-polyfill`

## 🗓️ Planned

- **More job boards** — Glassdoor, Monster, Wellfound (AngelList)
- **AI-extracted keywords & location** — Auto-fill Keywords and Place fields from job description

## 📐 Future Architecture

- **Auto-create Notion database** — One-click setup that creates a ready-to-use DB with all required properties, shared with the integration automatically
- **Custom field mapping** — Let users map extension fields to their own Notion property names instead of requiring exact naming
- **Storage backend alternatives** — Support for users without Notion:
  - Google Sheets export
  - Local CSV/JSON export
  - Airtable integration
  - Built-in local tracker (IndexedDB)

## 💭 Exploring

- **Analytics dashboard** — Visualize application stats (applied/rejected/interview rates)
- **Resume versioning** — Track multiple resume versions in Options
- **One-click apply** — Experimental auto-fill for job applications
- **Dark mode** — Respect system `prefers-color-scheme`
- **i18n** — Multi-language support
- **Extension landing page / website** — Dedicated site for marketing, install instructions, screenshots, changelog, and privacy policy
